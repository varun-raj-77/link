        A few months later, Bheem and his men are hiding in <span class="hovercard">Hathras</span>. When British soldiers arrive looking for Bheem, Sita, Ram's cousin and fiancée, senses the danger and drives away the British by telling them that the building is housing smallpox patients. She tells Bheem that Ram now faces a death sentence for saving his best friend. Bheem regrets his actions and promises Sita that he will rescue Ram. Bheem sneaks into the barracks with the help of blueprints given by Jenny. He frees Ram from the prison, mounting him on his shoulders to transport him. Together, they fight the police and escape. As Bheem treats Ram in the woods, they are ambushed by police and special forces soldiers. Ram takes a bow and arrows from a shrine of <span class="hovercard">Lord Rama</span> and retaliates. Bheem joins him with a spear. They fight off the soldiers and head towards the palace, eventually destroying the building by blasting a motorcycle into a room full of <span class="hovercard">TNT</span>. Bheem retrieves a massive cache of guns and delivers them to Ram. Catherine is killed in the chaos while Scott is killed by Ram and Bheem.
